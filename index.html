           <h2>Introduction</h2>
           <P>These are laws designed to increase your conscious awareness of the world around you.  You can think of these like scienfic laws in a way.</P>
           <p>They exist whether you choose to believe in them or not much in the same way as the force of gravity exists.</p>
           <p>With all of these laws we will give you the text and <em>some</em> additional understanding.</p>
           <P>If you would like to gain a deeper understanding of each law, I have a series of videos that explains each law in more detail and applies that law to your life today.</P>
           <P>Those videos, like this app, are completely free.  Simply head over to the <a href="#deeper">Go Deeper</a> page and create an account and access details for the videos will be sent to you.  Again, totally free of charge.</P>

           <h2>Some Understanding</h2>
           <P>In a nutshell what this law says is that all living things are capable and have the capability for their own growth.  Put another way, you have the capability yourself to find what you need (such as these laws) to further your own growth.  Said yet another way, you are not responsible for the growth of anyone else (short of your own children and even then only while they are children).</p>

           <h2>Some Understanding</h2>
           <P>This is the law which places the welfare, concern and feeling for others above yourself.  The law of love is that close affinity with all forces that you might associate with "good".  The Law of Love is that foce that denies a place for evil in the world, that resists not.  Love ofers the path of least resistance by cherishing, nuturing and protecting the beloved.</p>
            <p>Resisting evil simply strengthens it, just like weight training strengthens muscles.  Resist not evil.  Expose it yes, resist it no.</p>

           <P>All souls can be thought of as cells of the body of this Awareness/Law.  All souls can be thought of as the cells of the body of what science would call "super consciousness".</p>
           <p>Therefore there is no need for any entity to struggle or compete; for that would be like the left arm struggling to compete against the right.  That would simply be the body at war with itself and that is obvious foolishness.</p>
           <p>With the Law of One you can be at peace as a "cell" of the larger body of this awareness.  At peace with all other consciousnesses for they are simply an extension of you.</p>
           <p>This is a fixed and universal law and those who understand realize that in truth all is one and all that appears to be separate will, in the end, be nothing but an illusion to those who followed the path of separateness which appeared as scattered fragments.</p>
           <p>This awareness indicates the universe is one totality.</p>

            <h2>Some Understanding</h2>
            <P>This law is far more profound than many realize.  This law says that not only is what is, is ... but more importantly "what is" is not changed by any opinions or beliefs about it, but is what it is, while it is.</P>
            <p>This law states that actions and motives which are the highest and the best, the most Inclusive and encompassing, the most appropriate and essential, create those movements that lead to the Gate of Essence, behind which all things are exactly as they are, while they are, for Essence is the ever-changing truth that was, is and forever shall be.</p>
            <p>The essence is the "is-ness" of what is happening at any moment regardless of the length of timme included in that moment.  This awareness indicates that awareness of what "is" is total bliss and total union with the oneness of everything.</p>

            <h2>Some Understanding</h2>
            <P>All material forces rush to fill in a vacuum, rush to fill each hole, opening, void, blank page, field of clarity or empty moment with image, garbage, sound and fury, often signifying nothing so precious as the original voidness.  This law states that space allows movement, and that when all space is filled, the solidarity prevents further movement or growth.  By reducing bit by bit the inappropriate and the unnecessary aspects of one's lifestyle one can create the time, space, atmosphere and opportunities to move, grow, replenish and to rebuild on a more solid foundation.  This law creates the spaces in which to place on the highest and only the best with the least amount of energy and expense.</P>
            <P>This awareness indicates that ennergies create a vacuum behind them, the vacuum draws forth other energies.  That wherein entities move toward the light, wherein entities move toward higher spiritual dimensions, wherein entities move toward higher levels of consciousness, those entities create a vacuum which draws others to fill that void which the entity left behind, and in this manner when one entity progresses toward higher levels of awareness, others are drawn toward higher levels of awareness.</P>

            <P>The Law of Reconciliation, or the Principle of Reconciliation is that which finds in different qualities unifying similarities that allow these differences to be brought together. To accept the unifying qualities and diminish the differences, so that the differences in the qualities become less clashing and conflicting, and the unifying qualities become more binding. This is to reconcile, to find common denominators in things that are normally seen as separative and to emphasize and exaggerate and promote those common denominators; thus allowing the differences to fade away, or fall into proper alignment. The Law of Reconciliation, allows those things which are normally in conflict, to become harmonious in relationship to one another.</P>

            <P>The law of peace suggests that inner peace, nourishes external harmony and grows by increments and degrees, even as yes and no are merged into a maybe even as you and I are brought together into a week with inner peace, one can witness harmony, even in the midst of conflict. Through this law of peace, a soft response will often put a wrathful tongue to rest. </P>

            <h2>Some Understanding</h2>
            <P>The Law of Divine Manifestation requires a manifestor to believe in the principle that whatever is needed for one's growth and fruition will be supplied by the Universe, for whatever price the manifestor truly believes is fair. But the manifestor must believe he or she truly has the right to receive the manifestation at the price of energy cost the entity believes is fair</P>
            <P>If it is a worthy request, and the manifestor believes it is allotted at the time of asking, it will come. A worthy request, expressed through prayer, imaging, ritual or whatever method, is anything that harms no one, but benefits all involved. It is a win-win relationship. Anything that harms another, either in the process or the outcome of manifestation, is not of the Divine and will carry a karmic debt.</P>

            <h1>The Law of Poverty</h1>
            <h2>Text of the Law</h2>
            <p>This law has many aspects to it which are explained below</p>
            <h2>The Aspects of Poverty</h2>
            <p>The Law of Poverty states that to the degree one withholds one's productivity and energy in hopes someone else will offer theirs instead, to that same degree, an entity earns and experiences poverty. </p>
            <P>A second aspect of poverty comes to any who are productive and giving, but who fail to properly take hold and claim their proper reward in a suitable manner.
            <P>A third aspect of poverty comes to those who attempt to unfairly claim the energies of another. </P>
            <P>A fourth aspect of poverty comes to those who squander their blessings, spending their energies in a wasteful manner until they have spent their time, money, health, mind or other assets and have nothing left. </P>
            <P>A fifth aspect of poverty comes to those who become so fixated on pinching pennies they lose their friends, health and opportunities for being penny wise and pound foolish. Such persons often reject others or good opportunities in hasty reaction and poor discernment of the situation, thus losing a valuable asset or friend, or they may fail to avoid someone or something when it would be wise to do so; for not everything can be accepted or one will suffer from excessive garbage filling one's life.</P>
            <P>A sixth aspect of poverty comes to those who focus so much on one thing at any cost, that they fail to diversify and partake of the entire banquet of life and, in the end, find themselves with a vast amount of one thing, but having little else. </P>
            <P>A seventh aspect of poverty is that which comes to those who have been convinced that they are unworthy or incapable of having anything of value, because they are fated or destined or 'karmically cursed' to be in poverty, and by such belief they accept their suffering plight. </P>
            <P>An eighth aspect of poverty comes through the collective karma, the cultural karma such as: political, environmental, social, natural or geophysical forces that affect the masses and are usually impersonal to the injured individual. </P>
            <P>A ninth aspect of poverty comes to those who have been attacked by psychic curses from another, or by one's own sense of guilt from deep within the subconscious mind, to prevent the entity from having the benefits that would bring happiness. </P>
            <P>The tenth aspect of poverty comes to those who are given everything to make them happy, but have not learned that happiness must be generated from attitudes within or outer benefits will bring little or no relief.</P>

Anticipation results from imagery and preparation, fears and desires, based on fallacies or facts.  Preparation for change, changes consciousness, which results in physical change.</p>
            <P>The quality and quantity of description and imagery, the intensity and consistency and attitudes and actions, thhe collective or disruptive energies of others, all work together to influence the direction and course of the change.  Every entity to some degree, for good or ill, is both victim and master of the Law of Magic.  The Law of Magic is an extension of the Law of Unity.</P>

            <P>The Law of Affection states that affection is a beam of love which may light upon a subject and create an object of adoration.

            <P>The Law of Affection possesses not, yet sacrifices nothing of itself, for it gives without an expectation – even from the joy of giving. As the sun must shine to be the sun, so affection must give if one is to be affectionate. The Law of Affection cannot be manipulated or controlled, for its only purpose is to give. Nor can it be possessed or used, but one’s heart is open, it enters and possesses it and uses it to shine its warmth of love upon the world.</P>

This Law states that when one prospers all may prosper.</P>
            <P>The Law of Prosperity works for those who hold images, feelings, actions, dialogue, and attitudes associated with beauty, joy, love and prosperity, and works against those who hold images, feelings, actions, dialogues and attitudes associated with ugliness, self-pity, complaints, envy and hostility toward oneself or any other person, group, race, or class.</P>
            <P>Those who think, feel, act and speak of themselves as being poor and needy must spend three times the energy for the same prosperity received by those who think, feel, act, and speak of themselves as being wealthy and prosperous. An attitude that dwells in depression leads to the way of physical, spiritual, mental, social and financial depression.</P>
            <P>Those who maintain prosperous attitudes, even in states of poverty, are foreign to such states and will not be allowed to remain out of place in those poverty situations, but will instead be deported to those prosperous states where such prosperous attitudes belong.</P>

            <h2>Some Understanding</h2>
            <P>This Awareness indicates that essentially, when an entity begins to stagnate and move through life in a robot type of behavior pattern, the entity also begins to lose enthusiasm for life; this becomes purely mechanical in nature wherein the entity has indulged in all the thrills desired and nothing seems to change and the entity does not progress.</P>
            <P>This Awareness indicates when entities move along in actions wherein new discoveries relating to self, new self-discoveries are made, the entity then purges himself of the old and brings in the new energies of the discovery. This Awareness indicates this action increases enthusiasm. This Awareness indicates that the word ‘enthusiasm’ relates unto Spirit within, and the Spirit within is that which enhances the life-force factor. This Awareness indicates wherein an entity begins to lose that enthusiasm, the entity’s life is essentially stagnating, and as the stagnation continues, the entity begins to lose more and more of the protective aura around the body and around the psyche and the entity begins to lose more and more of the vitality of the physical and spiritual body.</P>
            <P>This Awareness suggests that as this vitality is lost through this stagnation, boredom and the lack of personal and spiritual growth, the entity’s depleted aura tends to draw in the forces which result in illness or accident or further weakening off the spiritual and physical body. This becomes likened unto an invitation to the higher forces, the so-called Lords of Karma, to take action to remove the entity from this plane.</P>
            <P>This Awareness indicates that the Law of Enthusiasm is that Law which allows entities to be filled with Spirit which then, in turn may be used for purposes that can create greater expressions of Spirit. This Awareness indicates that those who use enthusiasm for destructive purposes are those who shall reap the whirlwind of devastation on many planes and many levels thereafter.</P>

This relates unto the Law of magic in that anything described is on its course toward creating a manifestation to the degree of impact on its description. The nature of manifestation depends upon the intensity of the collective or disruptive energies involved.</P>

            <h2>Text of the Law</h2>
            <p>This is not a "law" in the way the others are.  It is that which creates the division, the illusion of separation, that allows for the other laws to have definition.</p>
            <h2>Some Understanding</h2>
            <P>The Archetypical Law is that law which is the prototype for the echoing reflections of the other laws.  The Law of Archetypes as that which serves as the skeleton or framework for the other laws.  The first Archetype as the Law of One.  The second as the Law of Two.  The third as the Law of Three.</P>
            <P>This apparent division is never-ending so long as the Law of Description is in effect.  Concepts and personalities, number, shapes, forms, situations that serve as patterns for others to follow are archetypes, even as the pyramid was an archetype for the hierarchy systems, and the zodiac shall be the archetype for the New World.</P>

            <p><em>Nothing happens until/unless something moves ... everything is always in motion.</em></p>
            <h2>Some Understanding</h2>
            <P>This awareness is about an understanding that if you want something to happen in your life then there has to be some kind of motion (or action) to achieving what you want.</P>
            <P>However this awareness is also an understanding that everything is always in motion and therefore <em>something</em> is going to happen.</P>
            <P>Therefore, why not choose what things move and choose what things will happen within your own life?  Put another way, you can make life happen or life can happen to you.  Not choosing which one happens is in fact a choice to allow life to happen to you ... and then you accepting that absolute lack of say or voice in your own life.</P>
