# laws
Basic HTML/jQuery/jQuery Mobile application that has the contents of The Cosmic Laws broken down.

As this is written JQM it is a "single page application" and is entirely created in some really basic HTML.

Several of the "laws" have not been added to the code (mostly because adding them is boring so I've been procrastinating). The PDf file that contains all of the laws is part of the project to make it easy for you to add them if you wish.

Installation is as simple as putting this on your webserver somewhere.
